# Agile Final Project - DevOps Certification (IBM)

## Project Overview

This repository contains the final project for the **DevOps Certification Course** through IBM. The project demonstrates key Agile and DevOps practices, focusing on sprint planning, backlog refinement, and the execution of a simulated sprint.

The scenario revolves around developing the backend product catalog for an e-commerce website. The primary features include creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting products from the catalog, tracking product likes, and hosting the solution in a cloud environment with automated deployments.

- **As Scrum Master**: I prepare the sprint milestone and ensure a subset of stories is ready for sprint execution.
- **As a Developer**: I manage the sprint backlog, move user stories across the kanban board, and complete a simulated sprint.

## Key Features

- **Product Management**: CRUD operations (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) for managing products in the catalog.
- **Likes Feature**: Track product likes for customer engagement insights.
- **Cloud Hosting**: The application will be hosted on a cloud platform with automated deployment pipelines for continuous integration and delivery.
